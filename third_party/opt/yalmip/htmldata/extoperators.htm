			<h2>Nonlinear operators</h2>
			<hr noshade size="1" color="#000000">
			<p>YALMIP supports modeling of nonlinear, often non-differentiable, 
			operators that typically occur in convex programming. Nine simple operators 
			are currently supported: <b>min</b>, <b>max</b>, <b>abs</b>, <b>sqrt</b>,
			<b>norm</b>, <b>sumk</b>, <b>sumabsk</b>, <b>geomean</b> and <b>cpower</b>, 
			and users can easily add their own (<a href="#operatorformat">see</a> the end of this page). The operators 
			can be used intuitively, and YALMIP will automatically try to find out 
			if they are used in a way that enables a convex representation. Although 
			this can simplify the modeling phase significantly in some cases, it 
			is recommended not to use these operators unless you know how to model 
			them by your self using epigraphs and composition rules of convex and 
			concave functions, why and when it can be done etc. The text-book
			<a href="readmore.htm#BOYDVAN2003">[S. Boyd and L. Vandenberghe]</a> 
			should be a suitable introduction for the beginner. </p>
			<p>In addition to modeling convex and concave operators and perform 
			automatic analysis and derivation of equivalent conic programs, YALMIP 
			also uses the nonlinear operator framework for implementing
			<a href="logic.htm">logic expression</a> involving <b>or</b> and <b>
			and</b>, and in the same vein but on a higher level, to handle piecewise 
			functions in <a href="reference.htm#pwf">pwf</a>.</p>
			<p>The nonlinear operator framework was initially implemented for 
			functions that can be modelled rigorously using conic constraints 
			and additional variables. However, there are many functions that 
			cannot be exactly modelled using conic constraints, such as 
			exponential functions and logarithms, but are convex or 
			concave, and of course can be analyzed in terms of convexity 
			preserving operations. These function are supported in a framework 
			called evaluation based nonlinear operators. The models using these 
			general convex functions will be analysed for convexity, but the 
			resulting model will be a problem that only can be solved using 
			a general nonlinear solver, such as <a href="solvers.htm#fmincon">
			fmincon</a>. See <a href="#evaluationbased">evaluation based nonlinear operators</a>. Note that 
			this extension still is experimental and not intended for large 
			problems.</p>
			<h3><a name="propagation"></a>Convexity analysis in 10 lines</h3>
			<p>Without going into theoretical details, the convexity analysis is 
			based on epi- and hypograph formulations, and composition rules. For 
			the compound expression <b>f = h(g(x))</b>, it holds that (For 
			simplicity, we write increasing, decreasing, convex and concave, but 
			the correct notation would be nondecreasing, nonincreasing, convex 
			or affine and concave or affine. This notation us used throughout 
			this manual and inside YALMIP)</p>

			<p>Based on this information, it is possible to recursively analyze 
			convexity of a complex expression involving convex and concave functions. 
			When <a href="reference.htm#solvesdp">solvesdp</a> is called, YALMIP 
			checks the convexity of objective function and constraints by using 
			information about the properties of the operators. If YALMIP manage 
			to prove convexity, graph formulations of the operators are automatically 
			introduced. This means that the operator is replaced with a graph, i.e., 
			a set of constraints. </p>

			<h3><a name="polynomials"></a>Polynomial and sigmonial expressions</h3>
			<p>By default, polynomial expressions (except quadratics) are not analyzed 
			with respect to convexity and conversion to a conic model is not performed. 
			Hence, if you add a constraint such as <code>set(x^4 + y^8-x^0.5 &lt; 10)</code>, 
			YALMIP may complain about convexity, even though we can see that the 
			expression is convex and can be represented using conic constraints. 
			More importantly, YALMIP will not try to derive an equivalent conic 
			model. However, by using the command <b>cpower</b> instead, rational 
			powers can be used. </p>
			<p>To illustrate this, first note the difference between a monomial 
			generated using overloaded power and a variable generated <b>cpower</b>.</p>

			<p>Note that when you plot sets with constraints involving nonlinear 
			operators and polynomials, it is recommended that you specify the variables 
			of interest in the second argument (YALMIP may otherwise plot the set 
			with respect to auxiliary variables introduced during the construction 
			of the conic model.)</p>
			<p>Do not use these operators unless you really need them. The conic 
			representation of rational powers easily grow large.</p>
			<h3>Limitations</h3>
			<p>If the convexity propagation fails, an error will be issued (error 
			code 14). Note that this does not imply that the model is nonconvex, 
			but only means that the simple sufficient conditions used for checking 
			convexity were violated. Failure is however typically an indication 
			of a bad model, and most often due to an actual nonconvex part in the 
			model. The problems above are all convex, but not this problem below, 
			due to the way <b>min</b> enters in the constraint.</p>

			<h3><a name="milp"></a>Mixed integer models</h3>
			<p>In some cases when the convexity analysis fails, it is possible 
			to tell YALMIP to switch from a graph based approach to a mixed 
			integer model based approach. In other words, if no graph model can 
			be derived, YALMIP introduces integer variables to model the 
			operators. This is currently implemented for <b>min</b>, <b>
			max</b>, <b>abs</b> and linear <b>norm</b> for real arguments. By default, this feature 
			is not invoked, but can be activated by <code>sdpsettings('allowmilp',1)</code>.</p>
			<p>Consider the following simple example which fails due to the 
			non-convex use of the convex <b>abs</b> operator</p>
			<table cellpadding="10" width="100%" id="table12">

			<h3><a name="evaluationbased"></a>Evaluation based nonlinear operators</h3>
			<p>YALMIP now also supports experimental support for general 
			convex/concave functions that cannot be modelled using conic 
			representations. The main difference when working with these 
			operators is that the problem always requires a general nonlinear 
			solver to solved, such as<a href="solvers.htm#fmincon"> fmincon</a>. 
			All convexity analysis is still performed tough.</p>

			performs pretty bad on problems with functions that aren't defined

			<h3>Behind the scene</h3>
			<p>If you want to look at the model that YALMIP generates, you can use 
			the two commands <code>model</code> and <code>expandmodel</code>. Please 
			note that these expanded models never should be used manually. The commands 
			described below should only be used for illustrating the process that 
			goes on behind the scenes.</p>
			<p>With the command <code>model</code>, the epi- or hypograph model 
			of the variable is returned. As an example, to model the maximum of 
			two scalars <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>, YALMIP generates two linear inequalities.</p>

			<p>For more advanced models with recursively used nonlinear operators, 
			the function <code>model</code> will not generate the complete model 
			since it does not recursively expand the arguments. For this case, use 
			the command <code>expandmodel</code>. This command takes two arguments, 
			a set of constraints and an objective function. To expand an expression, 
			just let the expression take the position as the objective function. 
			Note that the command assumes that the expansion is performed in order 
			to prove a convex function, hence if you expression is meant to be concave, 
			you need to negate it. To illustrate this, let us expand the objective 
			function in an extension of the geometric mean example above.</p>

			<h3><a name="operatorformat"></a>Adding new operators</h3>
			<p>If you want to add your own operator, all you need to do is to create

			operator for a numerical input, and return the epigraph (or hypograph) 
			and a descriptive structure of the operator when the first input is
			<code>&#39;graph&#39;</code>. As an example, the following file implements the 
			nonlinear operator <b>tracenorm</b>. This convex operator returns <b>
			sum(svd(X))</b> for matrices <b>X</b>. This value can also be described 
			as the minimizing argument of the optimization problem <b>min<sub>t,A,B</sub> 
			t</b> subject to <b>set([A X;X&#39; B] &gt; 0) + set(trace(A)+trace(B) &lt; 2*t)</b>.</p>

			<p>The function <code>sumk.m</code> in YALMIP is implemented using this 
			framework and might serve as an additional fairly simple example. The 
			overloaded operator <code>norm.m</code> is also defined using this method, 
			but is a bit more involved, since it supports different norms. Note 
			that we with a slight abuse of notation use the terms increasing and 
			decreasing instead of nondecreasing and nonincreasing.</p>
			<h3><a name="operatorformat0"></a>Adding new operators with mixed 
			integer models</h3>
			<p>If the convexity analysis fails, it is possible to have fall back 
			alternative models based on integer variables. If the operator is 
			called with the flag <code>milp</code>, a mixed integer exact model 
			can be 
			returned. As an illustration, here is a stripped down version of the 
			epigraph and MILP model of the absolute value of a real scalar.</p>

			<p>MILP models are most often based on so called big-M models. For 
			these methods to work well, it is important to have as small 
			constants M as possible, but in the code above, we just picked a 
			number. For the MILP models defined by default in YALMIP (<b>min</b>, 
			<b>max</b>, <b>abs</b> and linear <b>norms</b>), more effort is spent on 
			choosing the 
			constants. To learn more about how you can do this for your model, 
			please check out the code for these models.</p>
