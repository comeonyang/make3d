           <p>Important to note is that problems in YALMIP are modeled 
           internally in the dual format (your primal <i>problem</i> is in dual <i>
           form</i>). In control theory and many other fields, this is the 
           natural representation (we have a number of variables on which we 
           have inequality constraints), but in some fields (combinatorial 
           optimization), the primal form is often more natural.<p>Due to the choice 
           to work in the dual form, some problems are treated very 
           inefficiently in YALMIP. Consider the following problem in YALMIP.<table cellpadding="10" width="100%">

              <p>YALMIP will <i>explicitly</i> parameterize the variable <b>X</b> 
              with free 465 variables, <b>Y</b> with 6 free variables, create 
              two semidefinite constraints and introduce 3 equality constraints 
              in the dual form representation, corresponding to&nbsp; 471 equality 
              constraint, 2 semidefinite cones and 3 free variables in the 
              primal form.&nbsp; If we instead would have solved this 
              directly in the stated primal form, we have 3 equality 
              constraints, 2 semidefinite cones and no free variables, 
              corresponding to a dual form with 3 variables and two 
              semidefinite constraints. The computational effort is mainly 
              affected by the number of variables in the dual form and the size of the 
              semidefinite cones. Moreover, many solvers have robustness 
              problems with free variables in the primal form (equalities in the 
              dual form). Hence, in this case, this problem can probably be solved 
              much more efficiently if we could use an alternative model.<p>The 
           command <a href="reference.htm#dualize">dualize</a> can be used to 
           extract the primal form, and return the dual of 
           this problem in YALMIPs preferred dual form.<table cellpadding="10" width="100%">

              problems involving constraints of both dual and primal form. 
              Constraint in dual form <b>S(y)&ge;0 </b>are automatically changed to 
              <b>S(y)-X=0</b>, <b>X&ge;0</b>, and the dualization algorithm is

              dual form semidefinite constraints typically not gain from being 
              dualized, unless the dual form constraints are few and small 
              compared to the primal form constraints.<p>
          <img border="0" src="demoicon.gif" width="16" height="16"> A problem 
			involving translated cones <b>X&ge;C</b> where <b>C</b> is a 
			constant is automatically converted to a problem in standard primal 
			form, with no additional slacks variables. Hence, a lower bound on a 
			variable will typically reduce the size of a dualized problem, since 
			no free variables or slacks will be needed to model this cone. 
			Practice has shown that simple bound constraints of the type <b>x&#8805;L</b> 
			where <b>L</b> is a large negative number can lead to problems if one tries 
			to perform the associated variable change in order to write it as a 
			simple LP cone. Essentially, the dual cost will contain large 
			numbers. With a primal problem <b>{min 
			c<sup>T</sup>x, Ax=b, x&#8805;-L}</b>) will be converted to <b>{min c<sup>T</sup>z, 
			Az=b+AL, z&#8805;0}</b>) with the dual <b>{min (b+AL)<sup>T</sup>y, A<sup>T</sup>y<font face="Times New Roman">&#8804;</font>c}</b>.

          <img border="0" src="demoicon.gif" width="16" height="16"> Problems

          order constraint in standard primal form. If your cone constraint violates this 
          form, slacks will be introduced, except for translated second order 
			cones, just as in the semidefinite case. Note 
          that you need a primal-dual solver that can solve second order cone 
          constraints natively in order to recover the original variables

           <p>The drastic reduction in actual solution-time of the semidefinite 
			program comes at a price. Removing the equality constraints and 
			deriving a reduced basis with a smaller number of variables requires 
			computation of a QR factorization of a matrix of 
           dimension 1326 by 1276. The cost of doing this is roughly 2 seconds. 
			The total saving in computation time is however still high enough to 
			motivate the primalization.</p></td>
